PROJECT_RULES
Tech Stack

The Stefa.Books project uses the following stack, and all developers must adhere to it:

Frontend: Next.js 15.4.6 (App Router), React 19.1.0, TypeScript 5

UI/Styling: Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Lucide React

Animations: Framer Motion 12.23.12

Backend & Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions, RLS)

File & Media storage: Cloudinary

Infrastructure: Netlify (deploy, CDN)

Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier

Security: Row Level Security (RLS), input validation, .env for secrets

Development Checklists
1. Code Style & Structure

 Use TypeScript for all files

 Avoid any unless strictly necessary

 Components must follow folder structure: ui/, sections/, forms/, layouts/

 Shared components → /components/ui

 Custom hooks → /lib/hooks

 Animations must be done via Framer Motion

 Icons must use Lucide React (no emojis allowed)

2. Layout & Responsiveness

 Always use mobile-first approach

 Use rem and em instead of px

 Test layouts on 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px breakpoints

 Avoid fixed widths — use max-w, min-w, flex, grid

 Add skeleton-loading states for content

 All images must use lazy-loading

3. API & Supabase
 All database requests must go through supabase.ts (no direct fetch in components)

 RLS (Row Level Security) must be enabled for all tables

 Validate API input with Zod

 Store all keys in .env only

 Ensure security policies exist for books, users, subscriptions, rentals

4. UI/UX Guidelines

 Books are the main focus of the UI

 Color palette: warm tones (beige, sand, emerald accent)

 Typography: Literata (headings), Manrope (body text)

 All buttons and cards must have hover effects

 Header should be transparent with blur

 Book cards must include: cover, title, author, status, button

 Use micro-animations (scale/fade) for interactivity

5. Security

 Never hardcode Supabase/Cloudinary keys in code

 Use .env.local and .env.production

 Remove unused environment variables

 Do not expose private keys in API routes

 Validate all form inputs both client-side and server-side

 Restrict access to the admin panel by role (is_admin)

 SQL functions must explicitly define SECURITY DEFINER or INVOKER as required

6. Git & Repository

 Use Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, chore:)

 All changes must go through Pull Requests

 Run ESLint and Prettier before pushing (pnpm lint && pnpm format)

 Run build check before pushing (pnpm build)

 Do not commit temporary or unnecessary files
